Here are a few guidelines for contributing.

### Git Conventions
  * For Git branching I'm generally following the model laid out in this article [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

### Coding Conventions
  * Indentation uses 4 spaces.
  
  * I generally try to put a space after commas and around operators; however, I'm flexible on this issue and if it makes more sense without spaces then leave out the spaces.
  
  * Spare a thought for comments; while they don't have to be on every line, try not to forget about them entirely.
  
  * Generally just try to make things clear and it'll probably be fine.
  
  * And finally, don't forget to test your changes.


**Happy Coding!**
